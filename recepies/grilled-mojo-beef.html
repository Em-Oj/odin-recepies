        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds beef skirt steak</li>
            <li>3 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>1 large navel orange, juiced</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt for finishing</li>
            <li>Lime wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Cut skirt steaks into about 3 or 4 smaller pieces so it's easier to fit them into marinade dish.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Whisk orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, cumin, pepper, oregano, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Place skirt steak pieces, 1 at a time, into the marinade to thoroughly coat them. Add sliced onions and toss with the meat.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Transfer mixture and marinade to a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out air, seal bag, and place on a dish. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Transfer pieces of meat onto paper towel-lined rimmed sheet pan to drain for a couple of minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Cook over hot coals. Grill first side 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and grill second side until internal temperature is about 125 degrees F (53 degrees C). Look for a shiny glossy surface indicating the meat juice is coming to the surface; this indicates the meat is just about done. Transfer to a plate and allow meat to rest a few minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Slice into 1/2-inch slices and arrange on a serving plate. Spoon accumulated juices over the meat. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt and chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.</p>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
